title: Foundation QL
...

Foundation QL is a query language for Foundation DB. FQL
aims to make FDB's semantics feel natural and intuitive.
Common patterns like index indirection and chunked range
reads are first class citizens.

FQL may also be used as a [Go API](#language-integration)
which is structurally equivalent to the query language.

FQL is a work in-progress: the features mentioned in 
this document are not all implemented. Unimplemented 
features will be marked as such with a callout.

This document expects the reader to have a basic 
understanding of Foundation DB, and it's directory & 
tuple layers.

## Basics

An FQL query looks like a key-value. Queries include
sections for a directory, tuple, and value. FQL can only 
access keys encoded by the directory & tuples layers.

```fql
/my/directory("my","tuple")=4000
```

FQL queries may define a single key-value to be written (as
shown above) or may define a set of key-values to be read
from the database.

```fql
/my/directory("my","tuple")=<>
```

The query above has a variable `<>` in its value section 
and will read a single key-value from the database, if the 
key exists.

FQL queries can also perform range reads by including a
variable in the tuple section.

```fql
/my/directory(<>,"tuple")=<>
```

The query above will range read all key-values which 
conform to the schema defined by the query. For instance,
the key-value `/my/directory("my","tuple")=nil` conforms 
and would be returned.

All key-values with a certain prefix can be range read by
ending the tuple with `...`.

```fql
/my/directory("my","tuple",...)=<>
```

Including a variable in the directory tells FQL to perform
the read on all directory paths matching the schema.

```fql
/<>/directory("my","tuple")=<>
```

The value section may be omitted to imply a variable in
that section, meaning the following query is semantically
identical to the one above.

```fql
/<>/directory("my","tuple")
```

## Data Elements

In an FQL query, the directory, tuple, and value contain
instances of data elements. FQL utilizes the same types of
elements as the tuple layer. Example instances of these
types can be seen below.

| Type     | Example                                |
|:---------|:---------------------------------------|
| `nil`    | `nil`                                  |
| `int`    | `-14`                                  |
| `uint`   | `7`                                    |
| `bool`   | `true`                                 |
| `float`  | `33.4`                                 |
| `bigint` | `#35299340192843523485929848293291842` |
| `string` | `"string"`                             |
| `bytes`  | `0xa2bff2438312aac032`                 |
| `uuid`   | `5a5ebefd-2193-47e2-8def-f464fc698e31` |
| `tuple`  | `("hello",27.4,nil)`                   |

> __NOTE:__ `bigint` support is not yet implemented.

The directory may only contain strings. Directory strings 
don't need to be quoted if they only contain alphanumerics, 
`.`, or `_`. The tuple & value may contain any of the data
elements.

For the precise syntax definitions of each data type, see 
the [syntax document](syntax.ebnf).

## Data Encoding

The directory and tuple layers are responsible for 
encoding the data elements in the key section. As for the 
value section, FDB doesn't provide a standard encoding.

The table below outlines how data elements are encoded 
when present in the value section.

| Type     | Encoding                        |
|:---------|:--------------------------------|
| `nil`    | empty value                     |
| `int`    | 64-bit, 1's compliment          |
| `uint`   | 64-bit                          |
| `bool`   | single byte, `0x00` means false |
| `float`  | IEEE 754                        |
| `bigint` | not implemented yet             |
| `string` | ASCII                           |
| `bytes`  | as provided                     |
| `uuid`   | RFC 4122                        |
| `tuple`  | tuple layer                     |

## Variables

Queries without any variables result in a single key-value
being written. You can think of these queries as explicitly
defining a single key-value.

> __NOTE:__ Queries lacking a value section imply a variable
> in said section and therefore do not result in a write
> operation.

Queries with variables or `...` result in zero or more
key-values being read. You can think of these queries as
defining a set of possible key-values stored in the DB.

You can further limit the set of key-values read by
including a type constraint in the variable.

```fql
/my/directory("tuple",<int|string>)=<tuple>
```

In the query above, the 2nd element of the key's tuple must
be either an integer or string. Likewise, the value must be
a tuple.

## Index Indirection

```fql
/user/index/surname("Johnson",<userID:int>)
/user/entry(:userID,...)
```

## Language Integration

When integrating SQL into other languages, there are usually
two choices each with their own drawbacks:

1. Write literal SQL strings into your code. This is simple
   but type safety isn't usually checked till runtime.

2. Use an ORM and/or code generation. This is more complex
   and sometimes doesn't perfectly model SQL semantics, but
   does provide type safety.

FQL leans towards option #2 by providing a Go API which is
structurally equivalent to the query language. This allows
FQL semantics to be modeled in the host language's type
system.

This Go API may also be viewed as an FDB layer which unifies
the directory & tuple layers with the FDB base API.

```go
package example

import (
  "github.com/apple/foundationdb/bindings/go/src/fdb"
  "github.com/apple/foundationdb/bindings/go/src/fdb/directory"

  "github.com/janderland/fdbq/engine"
  "github.com/janderland/fdbq/engine/facade"
  kv "github.com/janderland/fdbq/keyval"
)

func _() {
  fdb.MustAPIVersion(620)
  eg := engine.New(facade.NewTransactor(fdb.MustOpenDefault(), directory.Root()))

  // /user/entry(22573,"Goodwin","Samuels")=nil
  query := kv.KeyValue{
    Key: kv.Key{
      Directory: kv.Directory{
        kv.String("user"),
        kv.String("entry"),
      },
      Tuple: kv.Tuple{
        kv.Int(22573),
        kv.String("Goodwin"),
        kv.String("Samuels"),
      },
    },
    Value: kv.Nil{},
  }

  // Perform the write.
  err := eg.Set(query);
  if err != nil {
    panic(err)
  }
}
```

Code generation tooling could be provided to lessen the
verbosity of the host language's syntax.

import (
  "github.com/apple/foundationdb/bindings/go/src/fdb"
  "github.com/apple/foundationdb/bindings/go/src/fdb/directory"

  "github.com/janderland/fdbq/engine"
  "github.com/janderland/fdbq/engine/facade"
  kv "github.com/janderland/fdbq/keyval"
)

// Generate a function `getFullName` which binds args to the query.
//go:generate fql --gen getFullName '/user/entry(?,<string>,<string>)'

func _() {
  fdb.MustAPIVersion(620)
  eg := engine.New(facade.NewTransactor(fdb.MustOpenDefault(), directory.Root()))

  const userID = 22573
  // Call the generated function which creates the query.
  query := getFullName(userID)
  res, err := eg.SingleRead(query)
  if err != nil {
    panic(err)
  }
  
  firstName := res.Key.Tuple[1].(string)
  LastName := res.Key.Tuple[2].(string)
}
```
