During college, I started messing around with vectorized art
via Adobe Illustrator. This was back in the day when you
could pirate a cracked version of software from less-than
savory sources. "Cracked" in this context refers to software
with it's piracy safeguards disabled. Older software often
required a passkey or online registration before it could be
used, but nameless hackers around the world would provide
patches which disabled these obstacles.

I don't have the original project files or higher resolution
images. These are pictures from a time that already feels
like ancient history. Perhaps they can be considered an ode
the life of young millennials, an ode to a time when piracy
was as easy and inconsequential as lying to a stranger.
