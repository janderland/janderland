title: Chocolate Icing
...

At 6:45a, my alarm goes off. I wake up feeling tired
& nauseous. My mouth is dry. I roll over in bed, shut of the
alarm, and take a long draw of glycerol vapor. The rush of
nicotine bears semblance to willpower.

Alongside a glass of water, I down a quarter tablet of
methylated amphetamine and prepare myself for the
approaching happiness. I take a cold 10-minute shower, timed
with Siri's assistance, followed by 5 minutes of deep
breathing, timed once again.

While I brush my teeth, I count the grey hairs on my head.
I spit out the toothpaste and acknowledge how heavy I'm
feeling. I'm still tired & nauseous.

Another drag of glycerol vapor as two laptops are tucked in
a backpack, along with a tablet, water bottle, and HHC oil.
The synthetic cannabinoid will be my afternoon pick me up.

I stumble out my front door, down an elevator, into my
apartment lobby, and finally onto the street. The air smells
like a couple parts-per-million, additionally polluted with
din. The sun is hidden behind a haze to which I contribute
another lung full of glycerol.

After a short retreat into a coffee shop, I return to the
city air. In hand, I have a blended mixture of butter, drip
coffee, and a shot of espresso. I equip my earbuds and take
a sip of my drink.

The song that plays is moderately tempoed. It's EQ lacks the
foundation of bass. A feminine voice, over-compressed and
autotuned, begins to sing about being young forever. And
with my second sip of buttered coffee, I feel it all coming
together.

"I am building the future" I think to myself. "I am changing
the world." The crosswalk light turns and I begin to step
into the street. Mid turn, a car abrudtly stops just shy of
hitting me and blares it's horn. I look the driver in the
eyes and smile. "I'm unstoppable."

I'm on my way to a small office where 23 single, young
adults are defining tomorrow by disrupting today. We're
competing with conglomerates and fighting for the little
guy. The planet needs our work to rid itself of economic
efficiencies. We are the saviors of the first world.

Just as I can manipulate my mood with the right molecular
mixture, our company can manipulate the digital landscape
for the better. Our services are essential.

TODO: Make analogy of company being chocolate cake.

I'm broken from my thoughts as my foot slides across the
pavement, leaving my legs spread in a broad stance. Behind
the slid foot is a trail of human feces smeared against the
concrete. I pause and then laugh as I realize it looks like
chocolate icing.
